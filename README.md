 ## Project Summary

For this project we have carried out a hypothesis test to determine if there was a significant difference in the median sentence lengths between the indigenous and non-indigenous offenders under the Correction Services Canada. The median was selected as the measure of central tendency and a permutation test under the null model was carried out computationally with a significance level of 0.05. The null hypothesis stated that there was no difference in the population medians in sentence length between indigenous and non-indigenous offenders. The alternate hypothesis stated that there is a difference in the population medians in sentence length between indigenous and non-indigenous offenders. The resulting sample difference in the two medians was -56 days, with a corresponding p-value of  0.0328. The indigenous group was found to have shorter sentence lengths than the non-indigenous group. As this p-vaule was smaller than the significance level, there was statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis that stated that there is no statistically significant difference in the median sentence lengths between the two groups. As we had a large sample size for both groups, our model was very sensitive to small differences in the median of both groups. Though this may raise some concern regarding the practical implications of the study, we believed it was important not to miss any existing effect due to the sensitivity of the issue at hand. The cost of a Type II error is more significant than a Type I error.   

The data set used for this study is the Offender Profile from 2017-2018 released by the Correctional Service of Canada. The link to this site can be found [here](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/844ff1e3-e137-41be-9ebe-6bd9843c1a53). Each entry in the data set corresponds to a single offender serving a two or more year long sentence. The demographic details such as age, gender and marital status at year end are provided for each entry. This was retrieved from the Offender Management System (OMS).
